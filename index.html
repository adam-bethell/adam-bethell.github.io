    <p>Hi, my name's Adam and I make things. Mostly things that are never released.</p>
    <p>Right now I'm making a C64 port of the card game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/121073/panic-lab">Panic Lab</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm keeping it all open source so <a href="https://github.com/adam-bethell/PanicLab64">have at it</a> (or maybe you <a href="https://github.com/adam-bethell/PanicLab64/raw/master/builds/main.prg">just want the .prg</a>).</p>
    <p>Is it a playable game? Not exactly. Does it load without crashing? Absolutely (at time of writing).</p>
